Hi. Friends. As a longtime blogger i'm about
to share my expiriance on daycare for elder ukrainians.
Ukrainians, especialy Elder ones with a marazmatic disorders
are also people who are as good as babies. They need care. They are here
to claim their special corner in our kind hearted mansion.
We as a united artists community is here to help them on
their last days to care about their hygiene
and show em we haven't forgot about their disabilitys and
their stories of a time being young that actualy passed so quick.
I mean. They need hug and care. Thats when animals gets in handy.
While they communicate with animales they feel joy of being
the natures only loved children even while dying.
That is how we let them forget about how old they are.
If you are an artist of a community consider joining our kind
hearted non profit collaboration. Kindly thank you for listening.
Peace.
